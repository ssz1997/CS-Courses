/**
 * A puzzle state represents the current arrangement of tiles on a sliding puzzle.
 * The puzzle board is a square, e.g. a 4x4 board. 
 * The number of empty slots is at least 1 and at most 3.
 * The encoding assumes that an empty slot (or blank tile) is represented with a zero
 * number. The state of the puzzle is the arrangement of tiles on the board.
 * 
 * The PuzzleStateInterface provides four move operations: up, down, left and right, by 
 * fixing a naming convention with an enum type Operation. 
 * An implementing class encapsulates the knowledge about the rules of the game, 
 * i.e. which move is possible in which state.
 * A move operation moves a tile from one position to an adjacent empty position.
 * It is also possible to drag a tile over multiple empty slots 
 * to a particular position.
 * 
 * A puzzle state can be used as a pure data container:
 * a) to store a tuple (state1,operation,state2) with the notion 
 * of a parent and operation. A particular state would store state2 as its state, state1 as 
 * its parent and operation as its operation. Get methods allow to retrieve this
 * information.
 * b) to store the length of a path from the initial state to the state
 * represented by the current puzzle state. This is a straightforward by-product of the 
 * computation of moves and successor puzzle states as the path length of the 
 * successor is just an increment by one. 
 * 
 * The parent is stored to support a shuffle function and an automatic (auto mode) function.
 * The shuffle function allows to create a random puzzle that needs a 
 * particular number of steps to get back to the solution.
 * The auto mode function provides a single step towards the solution and 
 * is useful to implement at GUI function that guides a user towards the solution.
 *  
 * Note that for a game, one would create the initial state and then
 * work from that state with move, drag or shuffle operations to obtain
 * new states.
 * 
 * Set-methods are absent for a good reason as they are not necessary
 * and their absence guarantees that the internal connection between states
 * with the parent relationship can not be invalidated by external calls
 * to overwrite value settings.
 * 
 * The intended usage is for a 4x4 board with 1, 2, or 3 empty slots.
